The Hotel Website is a responsive and visually appealing website designed to provide information about a hotel and its amenities. It aims to create an immersive user experience by incorporating modern web design techniques.

I used the following technologies in order to create the website:
HTML for creating the structure and content of web pages.

Used  CSS to style and layout the elements, including responsive design techniques.

Added interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website through using JavaScript and jQuery .

Used best practices in web design, including code organization, performance optimization, and user experience considerations.
